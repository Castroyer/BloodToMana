Arcane Transfuser is a mod all about little magical knickknacks mostly for my amusement.

The only item in the mod as of now is the Celestial Tick, which is a post moonlord item that allows you to bloodmage. 
It grants increased damage and mana regen, at the cost of draining HP and making you more susceptable to damage.

More items coming soon
Planned:
- Cat slime summons, and post moon lord variants.
- Bullets with wacky AI
